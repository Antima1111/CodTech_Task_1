# CodTech_Task_1 : API Integration and Data Visualization

This project is part of the CodTech internship and involves fetching real-time weather data using a public API and visualizing it using Python.  

The aim is to understand how API integration works and how to present data in a visually meaningful way using graphs.

## 📝 Task Objectives

1. Integrate the **OpenWeatherMap API** to fetch the 5-day weather forecast of **Mumbai**.
   
2. Extract and process only **12:00 PM temperature data** from the API response.
  
3. Create a **line plot** showing the temperature trend for 5 days using **Matplotlib**.
 
4. Build a beginner-friendly Python script with clean code and visualization.
